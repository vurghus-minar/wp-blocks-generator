# WP Block Boilerplate

This boilerplate is inspired by a combination of [create-guten-block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block), [WordPress/Gutenberg with blocks](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-examples) and [book-review-block](https://github.com/donnapep/book-review-block).

Uses webpack 4.x to generate a complete starter plugin.

## Installation

You can use the [wp-blocks-generator]() to quickly create a customised starter project or clone this repo to get started.

Run ```shell npm install``` to install dependencies.

## Get started

For development build run ```shell npm run dev```

For production run ```shell npm run build```

Upload generated plugin folder from ```dist``` to ```wp-content/plugins``` dir
